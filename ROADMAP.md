- [ ] Implement actual AI integration (OpenAI or similar) for automation generation
- [ ] Improve automation templates with more trigger, condition, and action options
- [ ] Add support for Home Assistant entity discovery
- [ ] Improve error handling and feedback
- [ ] Add validation for generated automations

## Mid-term Goals (v1.2.0)

- [ ] Support for local LLMs via Ollama integration
- [ ] Entity testing feature to validate devices before saving
- [ ] Template library for common automation patterns
- [ ] Voice input for automation descriptions
- [ ] Export/import of automation collections
- [ ] Support for scripts and scenes, not just automations

## Long-term Goals (v2.0.0)

- [ ] AI-powered automation debugging and improvement suggestions
